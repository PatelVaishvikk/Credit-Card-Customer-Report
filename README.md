# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

## Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive financial analysis dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze credit card transaction and customer data. The dashboard provides deep insights into revenue streams, customer demographics, and transaction patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making for financial services.

## What I Built
The project consists of two interconnected dashboards:

1. **Credit Card Transaction Report** - Focused on transaction metrics, card categories, and spending patterns
2. **Credit Card Customer Report** - Centered on customer demographics, income levels, and geographic distribution

## Technical Implementation
### Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI** - Primary development platform for creating interactive dashboards
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** - Used for creating calculated measures and KPIs
- **Power Query** - Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and modeling
- **Custom Visualizations** - Implemented for enhanced data representation

### Development Process
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Gathered financial transaction data from multiple sources
   - Cleansed and standardized data formats
   - Created relationships between transaction and customer datasets

2. **Dashboard Design**
   - Designed an intuitive UI with dark theme for better visualization
   - Created a consistent color scheme with teal/blue as primary colors
   - Implemented interactive filters (quarter, week, gender, card type)

3. **Metric Development**
   - Developed KPIs for revenue, interest, transaction volume
   - Created segmentation analysis by multiple dimensions
   - Implemented time-series analysis for trend identification
